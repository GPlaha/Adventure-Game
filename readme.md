# Adventure Game

In this project we were required to make a game which had an infinite map, have a "golden compass" leading to some treasure. Using WASD the player was able to move across the map. when the player crosses the edge of the map the character will appear on the corresponding side, resulting in a "infinite map". Using pythagoras theorem, the golden compass gives the distance towards the treasure, which once found ends the game.
